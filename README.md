# Graphical AVL Tree


This program is C++ implementation of AVL tree. One cool thing about this program is that it provides a graphical view of the entire AVL tree.

## What is AVL tree? ##

An AVL tree (named after their founders) is a balanced tree structure constructed upon binary tree concept. Balancing is a method of rotating the branches in such a way that the height of the tree from the root remains consistent.

This program will allow you to see exactly how the tree behaves and dynamically changes as you keep on adding/deleting the elements graphically!

Enjoy! ;)
